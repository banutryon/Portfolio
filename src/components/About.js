My passion to improve peopleâ€™s lives through technology will allow me to put in the work to make sure we understand the customer at a high level and create world-class products.

Having over 15 years of experience in consumer electronics has provided me with a solid understanding of how users interact with different technologies. I feel like this gives me an upper hand as a software engineer as I can look at the problem/project from many different angles before even beginning to write any code.
