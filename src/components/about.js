						As a software engineer, I will take my previous experiences and
						apply them to the projects at hand and provide a solution to your
						users that will make your company proud. My passion to improve
						peopleâ€™s lives through technology will allow me to put in the work
						to make sure we understand the customer at a high level and create
						world-class products.

					<p className="p" id="p">
						Having over 15 years of experience in consumer electronics has
						provided me with a solid understanding of how users interact with
						different technologies. I feel like this gives me an upper hand as a
						software engineer as I can look at the problem/project from many
						different angles before even beginning to write any code.
