			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
				As a software engineer, I will take my previous experiences and apply
				them to the projects at hand and provide a solution to your users that
				will make your company proud. My passion to improve peopleâ€™s lives
				through technology will allow me to put in the work to make sure we
				understand the customer at a high level and create world-class products.
				Having over 15 years of experience in consumer electronics has provided
				me with a solid understanding of how users interact with different
				technologies. I feel like this gives me an upper hand as a software
				engineer as I can look at the problem/project from many different angles
				before even beginning to write any code.
